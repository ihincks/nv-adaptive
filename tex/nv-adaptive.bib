	abstract = {The analysis of photon count data from the standard nitrogen vacancy (NV) measurement process is treated as a statistical inference problem. This has applications toward gaining better and more rigorous error bars for tasks such as parameter estimation (e.g. magnetometry), tomography, and randomized benchmarking. We start by providing a summary of the standard phenomenological model of the NV optical process in terms of Lindblad jump operators. This model is used to derive random variables describing emitted photons during measurement, to which finite visibility, dark counts, and imperfect state preparation are added. NV spin-state measurement is then stated as an abstract statistical inference problem consisting of an underlying biased coin obstructed by three Poisson rates. Relevant frequentist and Bayesian estimators are provided, discussed, and quantitatively compared. We show numerically that the risk of the maximum likelihood estimator is well approximated by the Cramér–Rao bound, for which we provide a simple formula. Of the estimators, we in particular promote the Bayes estimator, owing to its slightly better risk performance, and straightforward error propagation into more complex experiments. This is illustrated on experimental data, where quantum Hamiltonian learning is performed and cross-validated in a fully Bayesian setting, and compared to a more traditional weighted least squares fit.},

Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in the reported fidelities.

However, we introduce a feedback algorithm based on Bayesian inference to control this auxiliary phase shift. This makes the measurement close to a canonical one, with a phase variance scaling slightly above N−2. With no feedback, the best result (given that the phase to be measured is completely unknown) is a scaling of N−1.

	abstract = {Measurement underpins all quantitative science. A key example is the measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons) that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently, lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/—known as the standard quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured1,2 that it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N (ref. 3). It is commonly thought that achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states, such as the NOON state4,5. These states are extremely difficult to generate. Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N ≤ 6 (refs 6–15), but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit12,14 and none have shown Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev’s phase estimation algorithm16 using adaptive measurement theory17,18,19,20 to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision.},

	abstract = {We present the theory of how to achieve phase measurements with the minimum possible variance in ways that are readily implementable with current experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics have high-frequency fringes, such as those obtained from maximally path-entangled ({\textbar}N,0⟩+{\textbar}0,N⟩)/√2 (“NOON”) states, have commensurately high information yield (as quantified by the Fisher information). However, this information is also highly ambiguous because it does not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes. We provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly efficient way, providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is within a small constant factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. These techniques apply to NOON state and multipass interferometry, as well as phase measurements in quantum computing. We have reported the experimental implementation of some of these schemes with multipass interferometry elsewhere. Here, we present the theoretical foundation and also present some additional experimental results. There are three key innovations to the theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase properties of the sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via the equivalent two-mode state. Second, we identify the key feature of the equivalent state that enables the optimal scaling of the intrinsic phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables us to identify appropriate combinations of states to use. The remaining difficulty is that the ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinsic phase uncertainty are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to solve this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved. We consider both adaptive and nonadaptive measurement schemes.},

To date, experiments demonstrating entanglement-enhanced sub-SNL interferometry3,4,5,6, and most theoretical treatments7,8,9,10,11,12,13, have addressed the goal of increasing signal-to-noise ratios. This is suitable for phase-sensing—detecting small variations about an already known phase. However, it is not sufficient for ab initio phase-estimation—making a self-contained determination of a phase that is initially completely unknown within the interval [0, 2π). Both tasks are important2, but not equivalent. To move from the sensing regime to the ab initio estimation regime requires a non-trivial phase-estimation algorithm14,15,16,17. Here, we implement a ‘bottom-up’ approach, optimally utilizing the available entangled photon states, obtained by post-selection5,6. This enables us to demonstrate sub-SNL ab initio estimation of an unknown phase by entanglement-enhanced optical interferometry.},

	abstract = {Keeping Track of Photon Phase
In optical interferometers or optical communications, information is often stored in terms of the phase of the waveform or light pulse. However, fluctuations and noise can give rise to random jitter in the phase and amplitude of the optical pulses, making it difficult to keep track of the phase. Yonezawa et al. (p. 1514) developed a technique based on quantum mechanical squeezing to determine the phase of randomly varying optical waveforms. The quantum mechanical technique enhanced the precision with which the phase could be determined and, as optical technologies continue to be miniaturized, should be helpful in applications within metrology.
Tracking a randomly varying optical phase is a key task in metrology, with applications in optical communication. The best precision for optical-phase tracking has until now been limited by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of coherent light. Here, we surpass this coherent-state limit by using a continuous-wave beam in a phase-squeezed quantum state. Unlike in previous squeezing-enhanced metrology, restricted to phases with very small variation, the best tracking precision (for a fixed light intensity) is achieved for a finite degree of squeezing because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. By optimizing the squeezing, we track the phase with a mean square error 15 ± 4\% below the coherent-state limit.
A quantum mechanical technique is developed to enhance the phase tracking of photons.

Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are noise free. Here we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm works for noncommuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.},

In step (i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of α.

When one of the systems can be controlled and measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown frequency ωr, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of measurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy. However, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating between the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi oscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless carefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for efficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We find, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi oscillations during its relaxation time T1, O(103) measurement shots are sufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the unknown frequency ωr by a factor O(104) or larger.

We show this phase can be estimated with an uncertainty below 4×10−4 rad using as few as 176 total experimental samples, and our estimates exhibit Heisenberg scaling. Unlike standard phase estimation protocols, RPE neither assumes perfect state preparation and measurement, nor requires access to ancillae. We crossvalidate the results of RPE with the more resource-intensive protocol of gate set tomography.},

	abstract = {We derive, and experimentally demonstrate, an interferometric scheme for unambiguous phase estimation with precision scaling at the Heisenberg limit that does not require adaptive measurements. That is, with no prior knowledge of the phase, we can obtain an estimate of the phase with a standard deviation that is only a small constant factor larger than the minimum physically allowed value. Our scheme resolves the phase ambiguity that exists when multiple passes through a phase shift, or NOON states, are used to obtain improved phase resolution. Like a recently introduced adaptive technique (Higgins et al 2007 Nature 450 393), our experiment uses multiple applications of the phase shift on single photons. By not requiring adaptive measurements, but rather using a predetermined measurement sequence, the present scheme is both conceptually simpler and significantly easier to implement. Additionally, we demonstrate a simplified adaptive scheme that also surpasses the standard quantum limit for single passes.},

Applying the protocol on a transmon qubit achieves 0.999 average Clifford fidelity in one minute, as independently verified using randomized benchmarking and gate-set tomography. The adjustable sensitivity of the cost function allows the detection of fractional changes in the gate error with a nearly constant signal-to-noise ratio. The restless concept demonstrated can be readily extended to the tuneup of two-qubit gates and measurement operations.},

This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

	abstract = {The detection of ensembles of spins under ambient conditions has revolutionized the biological, chemical and physical sciences through magnetic resonance imaging1 and nuclear magnetic resonance2,3. Pushing sensing capabilities to the individual-spin level would enable unprecedented applications such as single-molecule structural imaging; however, the weak magnetic fields from single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques4. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale scanning magnetometers5,6,7,8, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but the ability to measure under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from an initialized single electron spin under ambient conditions using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer. Real-space, quantitative magnetic-field images are obtained by deterministically scanning our nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer 50 nm above a target electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically decoupled magnetometry protocols. We discuss how this single-spin detection enables the study of a variety of room-temperature phenomena in condensed-matter physics with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution and spin sensitivity.},

Recently, a technique has emerged that employs a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond as an atomic-size magnetometer, which promises significant advances. However, the effectiveness of the technique when applied to magnetic nanostructures remains to be demonstrated. Here we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer to image a magnetic vortex, which is one of the most iconic objects of nanomagnetism, owing to the small size ({\textasciitilde}10 nm) of the vortex core. We report three-dimensional, vectorial and quantitative measurements of the stray magnetic field emitted by a vortex in a ferromagnetic square dot, including the detection of the vortex core. We find excellent agreement with micromagnetic simulations, both for regular vortex structures and for higher-order magnetization states. These experiments establish scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry as a practical and unique tool for fundamental studies in nanomagnetism.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond1,2,3,4 has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing2,3,4,5,6, single-photon microscopy7,8, quantum information processing9 and bioimaging10. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope2,8,11,12, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (∼75 µs), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25 nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56 nT Hz–1/2 at a frequency of 33 kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres.},

However, in spite of its many outstanding demonstrations, the theory of the spin has not yet been fully developed, and there do not currently exist thorough explanations for many of its properties, such as the anisotropy of the electron g factor and the existence of Stark effects and strain splittings. In this work, the theory of the ground-state spin is fully developed using the molecular orbital theory of the center in order to provide detailed explanations for the spin's fine and hyperfine structures and its interactions with electric, magnetic, and strain fields. Given these explanations, a general solution is obtained for the spin in any given electric-magnetic-strain field configuration, and the effects of the fields on the spin's coherent evolution, relaxation, and inhomogeneous dephasing are examined. Thus, this work provides the essential theoretical tools for the precise control and modeling of this remarkable spin in its current and future applications.},
